## Approach & efficiency

as is required i needed to implement a binary search which is very efficient but has the downside of needing the array to be sorted in the first place

space complexity O(1)
creating several variables but none of them is an array

time complexity O(log n)
binary search moves by division which makes its time complexity
lower than most search algorithms

i would need to change how i access my data depending on the object
